                <h2> <strong>MODERN WAREFARE</strong> </h2>
                <p>
                    Call of Duty is a first-person shooter video game franchise published by Activision. Starting out in 2003, it first focused on games set in World War II. However, over time, the series has seen games set in modern times, the midst of the Cold War, futuristic worlds, and outer space. The games were first developed by Infinity Ward, then also by Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games. Several spin-off and handheld games were made by other developers. The most recent title, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, was released on October 25, 2019.

            <h3> <strong>How To Play ?</strong> </h3>
         
            <p> 
                It depends. If you’ve played a fps game before, you got the basics in your head already (aim down, hipfire, shoot, melee, sprint, crouch, prone, climb,and dive/slide). If you’re new to the fps genre, then I suggest playing against recruit bots in multiplayer (if the CoD game haves the option for bots though). Or start with the campaign to get used to the controls.

One important thing to note is this: never hipfire with a sniper rifle unless you’re very close to an enemy, the reason for this because the recitals are extremely wide, yet sniper rifles fire one shot. So it’s important to ADS ( Aim Down Sights) with a sniper rifle, and press the left thumper stick to hold breath while sniping to get an more accurate shot.

Note: you might see people “quick scoping” (the act of zooming in quickly and exiting the scope after shooting). This is problematic as snipers could be used in close like this (which makes shotguns, assault rifles, SMGs, and LMGs ineffective in close to medium range). Some players are upset of this, so try not to be quick scoping 24/7, so try to use other weapons if you think about quick scoping if you did it a few times.
